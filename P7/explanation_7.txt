Reasoning:
The router is basically a trie, with the content of each node being its handler.

Time Complexity:
- add_handler(): O(n), where n is the length of the path.
- lookup(): O(h), where h is the height of the trie.

Space Complexity:
O(m), where m is the total length of all paths that are added.
