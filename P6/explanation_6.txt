Reasoning:
The algorithm basically performs a one pass bubbling, i.e., one iteration of
bubble sort. As it bubbles both the maximum and minimum element at the same time,
only one traversal is needed.

Time Complexity:
O(n).

Space Complexity:
The additional space used by the algorithm does not grow with the size of the
input, which makes the space complexity O(1).
